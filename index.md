            <li> Note that traffic is limited as we had changed our heroku app link during the project and as such, have only been tracking traffic for a week</li>
            <li> However, ideally this should not affect the distribution of traffic significantly even as overall user numbers are low </li>

         <p> <strong> A/B Testing:</strong> </p>
       <ul>
            <li> For the A/B testing, we created a feature that randomizes the button to direct either to a /donate or /support page </li>
            <li> This feature and the code behind it was discussed with Professor Jensen as an acceptable approach to the project requirement </li>
            <li> While this feature is available and works in the code base, none of the bots clicked on the button. The only analysis we have is from our own usage of the site. As such, it has not been included in the final report </li>

         <ul>
            <li> We wrote new user stories and organised them into 3 sprints. For this sprint we focused                                    on                     the experience of a user visiting a site and hoping to find out information about existing events. The following sprints                         will focus on the experience of a user trying to register for an event, and on a manager trying to gauge information about                       traffic to their side 
            </li>
            <li> We created a git page repository so that our progress reports can be rendered through a browser </li>
            <li> We created and published a sprint burndown chart so that we can visually represent the progress of our project on these                        reports

            <li> We considered two ways of working: 1) Formalising agile workflow roles (product owner, scrum master, designer, developers, testers) 2) Each member partaking equally in each one role and working collaboratively across all delivery phases. We decided that we will assign 'roles' but these will represent accountability, we will all still support each other across the phases of delivery </li>
