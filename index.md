         <ul>
            <li> Loaded GitHub Repository Proud-Voice </li>
            <li> Created ZenHub for agile project management </li>
            <li> All team members joined ZenHub </li>
            <li> Held 1st team meeting to understand project requirements </li>
            <li> We considered two ways of working: 1) Formalising agile workflow roles (product owner, scrum master, designer, developers, testers) 2) Each member partaking equally in each one role and working collaboratively across all delivery phases. We decided that we will assign 'roles' but these will represent accountability, we will all still support each other across the phases of delivery </li>
