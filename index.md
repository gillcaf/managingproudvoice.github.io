         <ul>
            <li> We wrote new user stories and organised them into 3 sprints. For this sprint we focused                                    on                     the experience of a user visiting a site and hoping to find out information about existing events. The following sprints                         will focus on the experience of a user trying to register for an event, and on a manager trying to gauge information about                       traffic to their side 
            </li>
            <li> We created a git page repository so that our progress reports can be rendered through a browser </li>
            <li> We created and published a sprint burndown chart so that we can visually represent the progress of our project on these                        reports 
            </li>

            <li> Loaded GitHub Repository Proud-Voice </li>
            <li> Created ZenHub for agile project management </li>
            <li> All team members joined ZenHub </li>
            <li> Held 1st team meeting to understand project requirements </li>
            <li> We considered two ways of working: 1) Formalising agile workflow roles (product owner, scrum master, designer, developers, testers) 2) Each member partaking equally in each one role and working collaboratively across all delivery phases. We decided that we will assign 'roles' but these will represent accountability, we will all still support each other across the phases of delivery </li>
